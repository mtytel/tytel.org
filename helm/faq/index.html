        What is Helm?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Helm is a software synthesizer. You use it to create electronic music on your computer.

      <div class="faq-question">
        Is Helm really free?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes, Helm is free (as in no money) but more importantly, Helm is free as in freedom! This means you control this software, it doesn't control you.

      <div class="faq-question">
        Don't you need to make money, to like.. eat?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes please donate, I'm very hungry.
      </div>
      <div class="faq-question">
        I think I found a bug. What should I do?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Send me an email at <a href="mailto:matthewtytel@gmail.com">matthewtytel@gmail.com</a> and I'll fix it! Include information like what happened, a crash report if you have one, the operating system you're using (GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, Windows), if you're using the plugin version or standalone and any other info you think is useful.
      </div>
      <div class="faq-question">
        I'd like to help out! What can I do?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Besides donating, testing and reporting bugs is very helpful. I'd also really love sound samples, songs and any patches you've created that I can distribute with Helm. I have some sweet stickers for sale too!
