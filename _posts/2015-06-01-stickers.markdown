I got some stickers printed of the new logo! If you PayPal me $5 at
[matthewtytel@gmail.com](mailto:matthewtytel@gmail.com) and mention the
stickers and include your address I'll send you one :D

Since the synth is free this is a way of generating some (small) amount of
monetary support.

I got these die cut stickers through Sticker Mule. They make super high quality
vinyl stickers that are water/sun/scratch resistant. They can even go through
the dishwasher.

Dimensions are about 3in x 3in.
