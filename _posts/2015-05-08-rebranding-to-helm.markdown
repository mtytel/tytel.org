I'm doing a rebranding of this Twytch. First is renaming. Twytch was a little
too similar to the video streaming service 'Twitch' and so after playing around
with some logos and names I've decided on 'Helm'. It conveys control, a common
theme in synthesizers, it's short and easy to remember, and I can't find other
software that uses the name except for an emacs plugin.

The other part is a new icon/logo. Graphic design is something I spend a lot of
time on but doesn't come natural to me. After many hours I think I have a logo
I'm happy with. Here's the development in reverse chronological order.

### **I think it's more cute than cool and I'm good with that:**

### **Got to 'helmet' stage, but didn't like the shadows and square nose:**

### **Flipped it, it's almost a helmet and less of a plug:**

### **I like the cuts of the yellow circle being align with the blue circle:**

### **Getting away from that phallic design:**

### **Trying a different flat, bold, outline style:**

### **First design, it's supposed to be a plug. Pretty phallic though:**
