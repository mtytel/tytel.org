I'm working on a new synth! The goal: create the most popular synthesizer in the world..
Not sure if that's achievable, let alone measureable, but if I hit a million downloads I think
I'll call it a success.

So you want to hear about features. You'll have to stay tuned for more blog posts then! I can tell
you now that there are some analog modelled filters (ZDF, WTF? BBQ), interesting modulation
capabilities and a very visual and animated UI (with low CPU usage).

And for those wondering, this new synth will be open-source and pay-what-you-want like just like
[Helm][helm].
