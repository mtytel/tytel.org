Whew, it's been a while and a lot has changed! I've decided to make Twytch
a free and open source project releasing it under GNU. My new goal is to
make a very accessible free synth that runs on most platforms. Because of this
I've cut back a lot of the more experimental features like glitches in place
of more established ones like unison and a good modulation system.

The new modulation system is heavily inspired by Bitwig Studio though I don't
think they were the original creators of this type of system. I'll talk more
about how it works in a different post.

I've made a bunch of changes to the UI and there's a lot more coming! I find
going back through the iterations entertaining so I'm posting them all here.
The most recent changes are inspired by [Material Design][material-design]
which has heavy shadow usage. I used to think drop shadows were pretty
outdated, but when combined with a flat UI, it looks really fresh.

Here are the UI screenshots in reverse chronological order:


### **Material design attempt 1 and new colors:**

### **I'm not sure if I want this entire synth to be purple:**
