      <p>I made many of the assets inside of the <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17770">Leap Motion V2 Unity Assets</a>. They contain features like rigged hand movement, hand creation/deletion management, hand physics, scripts for grabbing objects, and several examples. Some notable apps that were built on these assets are <a href="https://apps.leapmotion.com/apps/form-and-function-3d/osx">Form and Function</a>, <a href="https://apps.leapmotion.com/apps/aboard-the-lookinglass/osx">Aboard the Lookinglass</a>, <a href="https://apps.leapmotion.com/apps/weightless/osx">Weightless</a>, <a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/gallery/world-of-comenius">World of Comenius</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XNnWbfpO3c&feature=youtu.be">Soundscape VR</a>.</p>
      <p>The video below is a bunch of small demos I made using the V2 assets. Everything I worked on is open source and you can check out the projects at <a href="https://github.com/leapmotion-examples/">https://github.com/leapmotion-examples/</a></p>
